# Handwritten-character-recognition-using-CNN

This is an implemention of a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize handwritten 
characters.Goal of the project was to develop an accurate and robust system for automatic recognition of handwritten 
characters, enabling applications in optical character recognition (OCR) and digitized document processing.
